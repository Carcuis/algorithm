# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters - Medium

[leetcode.com - longest substring without repeating characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

## Topics

* Hash Table
* String
* Sliding Window

## Example 1

    │ Input: s = "abcabcbb"
    │ Output: 3
    │ Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

## Example 2

    │ Input: s = "bbbbb"
    │ Output: 1
    │ Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

## Example 3

    │ Input: s = "pwwkew"
    │ Output: 3
    │ Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
    │ Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Constraints

* `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`

* `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Using Sliding Window

> Runtime: 23 ms, beats 32.28%. Memory: 17.56 MB, beats 34.66%.

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        start = max_length = 0

        for index, char in enumerate(s):
            if char in s[start:index]:
                max_length = max(index - start, max_length)
                start = s[start:index].index(char) + 1 + start
            max_length = max(index - start + 1, max_length)

        return max_length
```

### Approach 2: Using Hash Table

> Runtime: 3 ms, beats 99.95%. Memory: 17.97 MB, beats 10.49%.

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        start = -1
        max_length = 0
        char_index: dict[str, int] = {}

        for index, char in enumerate(s):
            if char in char_index and char_index[char] > start:
                start = char_index[char]
            char_index[char] = index
            max_length = max(index - start, max_length)

        return max_length
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> `char_index[char] > start` ensures that start should not go back to the left of the repeating character.
