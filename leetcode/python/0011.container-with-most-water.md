# 11. Container With Most Water - Medium

[leetcode.com - container with most water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints
of the `i^th` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return *the maximum amount of water a container can store*.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

## Topics

* Array
* Two Pointers
* Greedy

## Example 1

    │ Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
    │ Output: 49
    │ Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

## Example 2

    │ Input: height = [1,1]
    │ Output: 1

## Constraints

* `n == height.length`

* `2 <= n <= 10^5`

* `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution

### Approach 1: Brute Force

> Time Limit Exceeded.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: list[int]) -> int:
        max_area = 0
        for i in range(len(height)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(height)):
                max_area = max(max_area, (j - i) * min(height[i], height[j]))
        return max_area
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Time complexity: `O(n^2)`.
> * Space complexity: `O(1)`.

### Approach 2: Two Pointers

> Runtime: 110ms, beats 23.26%. Memory: 28.54MB, beats 11.78%.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: list[int]) -> int:
        max_area = 0
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        while left < right:
            max_area = max(max_area, (right - left) * min(height[left], height[right]))
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        return max_area
```
