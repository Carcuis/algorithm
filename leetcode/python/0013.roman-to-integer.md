# 13. Roman to Integer - Easy

[leetcode.com - roman to integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

| Symbol | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| I      | 1     |
| V      | 5     |
| X      | 10    |
| L      | 50    |
| C      | 100   |
| D      | 500   |
| M      | 1000  |

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.

* `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.

* `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

## Example 1

    │ Input: s = "III"
    │ Output: 3
    │ Explanation: III = 3.

## Example 2

    │ Input: s = "LVIII"
    │ Output: 58
    │ Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

## Example 3

    │ Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
    │ Output: 1994
    │ Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

## Constraints

* `1 <= s.length <= 15`

* `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.

* It is **guaranteed** that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Use `str.replace`

> Runtime: 13ms, beats 7.59%. Memory: 17.70MB, beats 59.58%.

```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        roman_map: dict[str, int] = {
            "CM": 900, "M": 1000, "CD": 400, "D": 500,
            "XC": 90, "C": 100, "XL": 40, "L": 50,
            "IX": 9, "X": 10, "IV": 4, "V": 5, "I": 1,
        }
        for symbol in roman_map:
            s = s.replace(symbol, f"{roman_map[symbol]},")
        return sum(int(x) for x in s.split(",") if x)
```

### Approach 2: Compare Neighboring Symbols

> Runtime: 5ms, beats 53.64%. Memory: 17.88MB, beats 37.28%.

```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        roman_map: dict[str, int] = {
            "I": 1, "V": 5, "X": 10, "L": 50, "C": 100, "D": 500, "M": 1000
        }

        result = 0
        for l, r in zip(s, s[1:]):
            if roman_map[l] < roman_map[r]:
                result -= roman_map[l]
            else:
                result += roman_map[l]

        return result + roman_map[s[-1]]
```

### Approach 3: Reverse Iterate

> Runtime: 0ms, beats 100.00%. Memory: 17.59MB, beats 90.99%.

```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        roman_map: dict[str, int] = {
            "I": 1, "V": 5, "X": 10, "L": 50, "C": 100, "D": 500, "M": 1000
        }

        result = 0
        for c in reversed(s):
            num = roman_map[c]
            result += num if result < 5 * num else -num

        return result
```
